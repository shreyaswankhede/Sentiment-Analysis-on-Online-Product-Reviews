# Sentiment Analysis:

* Sentiment analysis and Opinion mining is the computational study of User opinion to analyze the social, psychological, philosophical, behavior and perception of an individual person or a group of people about a product, policy, services and specific situations using Machine learning technique. Sentiment analysis is an important research area that identifies the peopleâ€™s sentiment underlying a text and helps in decision making about the product.

# Customer Product reviews:

# Feature Extraction:

* In order to make sense to our machine learning algorithm we have converted each review to a numeric representation which is called 'Vectorization'.

* The system uses TF-IDF Vectorizer (Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency) that transforms a count matrix to a normalized frequency representation in float.

* Splitting the data into Train and Test set (70-30).
